## HW 7 Bivariate Regression

# Question 1

```{r}
# load necessary packages 
library(tidyverse)
# specify path to world data 
getwd()
setwd("/Users/jackjeffrey/Documents/Poli502_Jeffrey/Data")
# assign world data an object
world <- read.csv("world.csv")
# view summary statistics for women and gdp variables 
summary(world$women09)
length(world$women09)
# mean of 17.18 with 11 NA's
# 191 countries
summary(world$gdp10_thou)
# length 0 class and mode both null
```

# Graphical univariate analysis

```{r}
# Histogram for (women09) variable
hist(world$women09, main="Distribution of Female Representation (women09)",
     xlab="Female Representation (women09)", col="lightblue", border="black", 
     breaks=15)
# female representation is the highest from 10-20 and starts to get progressively lower. 
# Remove rows with missing data in either 'gdp_10_thou' or 'women09'
world_clean <- world[!is.na(world$gdp_10_thou) & !is.na(world$women09), ]
# view summary of gdp_10_thou cleaned
summary(world_clean$gdp_10_thou)
# mean of 0.6258 with min of 0.0090 and max of 4.7354
# Histogram of economic developement variable
hist(world_clean$gdp_10_thou, main = "Distribution of Economic Development", 
     xlab = "GDP (in thousands)", col = "lightblue", border = "black")
# gdp recorded in thousands, highest peak in the 0-1 range with a frequency/countries over 120, significantly drops off after that. 
```

# Question 2.

```{r}
length(world_clean$women09)
# With NA's removed its down to 169 countries
length(world_clean$gdp_10_thou)
# With NA's removed length is no longer null and there are 169 countries
```

# Question 3.

```{r}
# Calculate correlation coeficcient 
cor_coefficient <- cor(world_clean$women09, world_clean$gdp_10_thou)
cor_coefficient
# The correlation coeficcient is 0.305, positive moderate linear 
# relationship, as economic developement increases female representation 
# slighly increases
# Test for statistical significance 
cor_test <- cor.test(world_clean$women09, world_clean$gdp_10_thou)
cor_test
# p-value of 5.501e-05 is much smaller 0.05 so we can reject the null, the # relationship is statistically significant at both the 95% and 99% 
# confidence interval
# 95 confidence interval of 0.161, 0.436
# T score of 4.14 indicating a significant relationship
# degrees of freedom equal to 167
```

# Question 4

```{r}
# Null Hypothesis (H0): (gdp_10_thou) has no effect on (women09).The slope # of the regression line is zero.

# Alternative Hypothesis (H1):(gdp_10_thou) has a significant effect on

# (women09).The slope of the regression line (beta_1) is not zero.
```

# Question 5

```{r}
# Run the linear regression model
model <- lm(women09 ~ gdp_10_thou, data = world_clean)
# View regression output
summary(model)
# Estimated regression equation
# (a) women09 = 14.8430 + 3.4574*gdp_10_thou
# Sign for the coefficient of X
# (b) X coefficient equals 3.4574 and is positive 
# Size of coefficient X 
# (c) Size is 3.4574, for every unit increase of X, Y increases by 3.4574
# Significance and condidence level | if increased by 10,000 dollars 
# women09 would increase by 3.4574% and if increased by 1,000 dollars 
# women09 would increase by 0.34574%. 
# (d) P-value of 5.501e-05 is much smaller than 0.05 and is statistically # significant at the 99% confidence level, strong evidence to rject null 
# hypothesis. 
```

# Question 6

```{r}
# graph regression results 
ggplot(data = world_clean, aes(x = gdp_10_thou, y = women09)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", fill = "pink", se = TRUE) +  
  labs(
    title = "Marginal Effect of Economic Development on Female Representation",
    x = "Economic Development (GDP)",
    y = "Female Representation"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Graph interpretation

```{r}
# The scatter plot points show the actual data, while the red regression line indicates the predicted relationship. The positive relationship indicates that as GDP increases female representation increases. 
```

# Question 7

```{r}
# vew regression statistics 
summary(model) 
# Based on the R sqaured resukt of 0.09308, only a 9.31% of women09 is 
# explained by gdp_10_thou, this is too small of a value to confident that # women09 is caused by gdp_10_thou. 
# There is a residual standard error of 10.38% which is quite large
# considering women09 is in percentages and is probably too large to feel
# good about the model. 
```

# Question 8

```{r}
# obtain predicted values for women09 
world_clean$predicted_women09 <- predict(model)
# find the predicted and actual values for women09 in Rwanda 
rwanda_predicted <- world_clean$predicted_women09[world_clean$country == "Rwanda"]
rwanda_actual <- world_clean$women09[world_clean$country == "Rwanda"]
# Calculate difference between actual and predicted values 
residual_rwanda <- rwanda_actual - rwanda_predicted
# evaluate values
cat("Predicted value for Rwanda:", rwanda_predicted, "\n")
cat("Actual value for Rwanda:", rwanda_actual, "\n")
cat("Difference (residual) for Rwanda:", residual_rwanda, "\n")
# interpretation - the models predcited value verses the actual value is 
# noticeably different. The residual is 41.38 which indicates the model is
# not well suited to fit Rwanda. 
```

# Question 9

```{r}
# Create a smaller subset for PR and non PR countries 
pr_countries <- world_clean[world_clean$pr_sys == "Yes", ]
non_pr_countries <- world_clean[world_clean$pr_sys == "No", ]
# View observations for each object
cat("Number of PR countries:", nrow(pr_countries), "\n")
cat("Number of Non-PR countries:", nrow(non_pr_countries), "\n")
# 63 PR countries 
# 106 Non-PR countries

# Regression for PR countries 
pr_model <- lm(women09 ~ gdp_10_thou, data = pr_countries)
cat("Regression results for PR countries:\n")
summary(pr_model)
# Regression for Non-PR Countries
non_pr_model <- lm(women09 ~ gdp_10_thou, data = non_pr_countries)
cat("Regression results for Non-PR countries:\n")
summary(non_pr_model)
```

# Question 10

```{r}
# Extract regression coeficcients from PR model
intercept <- coef(pr_model)[1]
slope <- coef(pr_model)[2]
# Print regression equation
cat("Estimated regression equation for PR countries: women09 =", round(intercept, 2), "+", round(slope, 2), "* gdp_10_thou\n")
# Estimated regression equation for PR countries: women09 = 19.38 + 3.64 *
# gdp_10_thou
# Interpretation 
cat("For PR countries, every additional unit increase in GDP (in thousands) is associated with an increase of", 
    round(slope, 2), "% in female representation.\n")
# For PR countries, every additional unit increase in GDP (in thousands) is associated with an increase of 3.64 % in female representation.

# Graph scatterplot for PR countries 
ggplot(pr_countries, aes(x = gdp_10_thou, y = women09)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +  # Add scatterplot points
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red", fill = "pink", se = TRUE) +  # Add regression line with confidence interval
  labs(
    title = "Effect of Economic Development on Female Representation for PR Countries",
    x = "Economic Development (GDP in Thousands)",
    y = "Female Representation (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
# Graph Interpretation
```{r}
# This is a weak positive relationship. The wide confidence intervals
# suggest more variability in the data. There relationship between the two
# variables is weaker in Non-PR compared to PR countries. 
```
# Question 11

```{r}
# Extract regression coefficients for Non-Pr countries
intercept_nonpr <- coef(non_pr_model)[1]
slope_nonpr <- coef(non_pr_model)[2]
# Print regression equation
cat("Estimated regression equation for non-PR countries: women09 =", round(intercept_nonpr, 2), "+", round(slope_nonpr, 2), "* gdp_10_thou\n")
# Estimated regression equation for non-PR countries: women09 = 12.96 +
# 1.66 * gdp_10_thou
# Interpretation
cat("For non-PR countries, every additional unit increase in GDP (in thousands) is associated with an increase of", 
    round(slope_nonpr, 2), "% in female representation.\n")
# For non-PR countries, every additional unit increase in GDP (in
# thousands) is associated with an increase of 1.66 % in female
# representation.

# Graph scatterplot for Non-Pr countries
ggplot(non_pr_countries, aes(x = gdp_10_thou, y = women09)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue", alpha = 0.6) +  # Scatterplot points

    title = "Effect of Economic Development on Female Representation for Non-PR Countries",
    x = "Economic Development (GDP in Thousands)",
    y = "Female Representation (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Question 12

```{r}
# Find predicted values for PR countries
pr_countries$predicted_women09 <- predict(pr_model, newdata = pr_countries)
# Find predicted and actual values for Rwanda
rwanda_predicted <- pr_countries$predicted_women09[pr_countries$country == "Rwanda"]
rwanda_actual <- pr_countries$women09[pr_countries$country == "Rwanda"]
# Print predicted and actual values
cat("Predicted Female Representation for Rwanda:", round(rwanda_predicted, 2), "%\n")
cat("Actual Female Representation for Rwanda:", round(rwanda_actual, 2), "%\n")
# Predicted Female Representation for Rwanda: 19.45 %
# Actual Female Representation for Rwanda: 56.3 %

# Calculate and print residual
residual_rwanda <- rwanda_actual - rwanda_predicted
cat("Difference (Residual) between predicted and actual value for Rwanda:", round(residual_rwanda, 2), "%\n")
# Difference (Residual) between predicted and actual value for Rwanda:
# 36.85 %
# The model underestimated the actual value by 36.85%. Based on the model # it cannot be conluded that economic development will lead to an increase # in femal representation in Rwanda. There are likely many other variables # influencing female representation in the country.
