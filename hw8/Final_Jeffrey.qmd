# Interpretation of results 
# The p-value of 1.585e-09 is extremely small, 
# the difference in means between female and male passengers 
# is statistically significant so the null hypothesis can be rejected. 
# The confidence interval for the difference in means 
# does not contain 0, which confirms a significant difference 
# between the fares for females and males.

```{r}
# Based on the ROC curves and AUC scores, the model 
# that includes the logged fare variable performs better. 
# This is evident from its higher AUC score, which indicates 
# that it is more effective in distinguishing between survival 
# and non-survival outcomes compared to the model that only 
# includes female and child variables. Therefore, the 
# inclusion of the logged fare variable enhances 
# the model's predictive ability.
